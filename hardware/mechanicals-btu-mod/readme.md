## Ploopy Adept BTU Mod by bomtarnes ([keyboard-magpie](https://github.com/keyboard-magpie/))
Included are two print files- 

 - adept-btu-plate.3mf - this includes an integrated support enforcer- I recommend organic supports and "for support enforcers only in prusaslicer
 - adept-btu-top-v1.stl - old fashioned STL for doing as you wish with

Also included is a step file, and a fusion 360 export (my CAD is all self taught and very messy, timeline wise, sorry).

The intended BTUs for v1 are [these veichu ones](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003066404497.html) in 7.5 size.

I am actively working on other versions for other BTU varieties and will aim to add these in the future.
